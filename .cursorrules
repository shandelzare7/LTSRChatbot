## Claude Command Usage

When the user mentions "claude" or "问claude" or similar phrases, it means they want to use the terminal command `claude` to solve their problem. Automatically execute the `claude` command with the appropriate prompt based on the user's question.

Example: If user says "问claude关于网络错误的问题"，run:
```bash
claude -p "关于网络错误的问题：[用户的具体问题]"
```
